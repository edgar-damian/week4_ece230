# Lab 04 - SOP/POS and KMaps

In this lab, you’ve learned how to apply KMaps, Sum Of Products and Products of
sums to simplify digital logic equations. Then, you’ve proven out that they work
using an implemented design on your Basys3 boards.

## Lab Summary

In this lab, we implemented naive SOP, simplified minterms (SOP), and simplified maxterms (POS). We learned how to make a truth table translate into different logical representations using AND and OR. We then confirmed that all  of them were equivalent to one another and implemented them into our Basys board. Overall, this lab helped us practice K-Maps and understand how they are related to one another.


## Lab Questions

### Why are the groups of 1’s (or 0’s) that we select in the KMap able to go across edges?


### Why are the names Sum of Products and Products of Sums?
The names help describe the structure of the Boolean expressions, for example, SOP is an expression defined by a sum (OR) of products (AND). In comparison, POS is defined by a product (AND) of sums (OR). 

### Open the test.v file – how are we able to check that the signals match using XOR?
